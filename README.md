Software Products eCommerce Sales — Apr 2024 to Oct 2025
(Powered by ONYXDataDNA — November ’25 Challenge)

Over the course of 18 months, I explored a real-world eCommerce dataset focusing on software and subscription products — generously provided by ONYXDataDNA for their November 2025 Data Challenge.

What unfolded was a clear picture of a business built on strong customer loyalty, high-value software subscriptions, and globally distributed demand.

📘 The Story Behind the Data

From 22 April 2024 to 21 October 2025, customers purchased a diverse portfolio of digital tools — AI products, developer tools, productivity suites, cloud solutions, and creative software.

What surprised me wasn’t just the $31.8M in total revenue…
It was the consistency. The retention.
The predictable rhythm of subscriptions driving almost every major number.

Here’s the narrative the data uncovered:

📊 Revenue Built on Strong Foundations

Website and Direct Sales channels delivered most of the revenue, backed by a very low refund rate of just 2.1%.
This shows two things:
✔ Customers know what they are buying.
✔ Products deliver on their promise.

The monthly revenue trend remained stable — no huge drops, no volatility — mainly because subscription products soften fluctuations.

👥 Customers Who Keep Coming Back

Out of 48K+ customers, 4K were loyal, purchasing more than 4 times.
This group alone contributes a major share of revenue, with an impressive customer lifetime revenue of $7.96K.

Repeat buyers came back within 45 days — one of the strongest signs of healthy product adoption.

In short: Retention is the real hero of this dataset.

🛍️ Product & Category Performance

The top-selling products are familiar names:

Microsoft 365

Azure AI Studio

Adobe Creative Cloud

Datadog Pro

Tableau Creator

These products dominate revenue not because they’re popular…
…but because they solve recurring problems for customers.

With 97% of total revenue coming from subscription SKUs, the business benefits from highly predictable recurring revenue — a key advantage in the digital economy.

Categories like Developer Tools, AI Tools, and Productivity Suites lead the revenue charts.

💸 Pricing, Discounts & Purchase Behavior

Discount utilization sits at 35%, suggesting discounts are strategically used — not overused.
Even products with higher price points show solid conversion.

With 100% conversion in the dataset context, the product catalog successfully converts customer interest into completed purchases.

🌍 Geographic Strengths

The customer base is global, with strong concentrations in:

North America

Europe

India

Singapore

Australia

Loyal customer hotspots mirror revenue hotspots — clear indicators for future growth and marketing focus.
