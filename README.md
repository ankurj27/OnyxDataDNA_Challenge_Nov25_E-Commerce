# OnyxDataDNA_Challenge_Nov25_E-Commerce
(Software Products eCommerce Sales — Apr 2024 to Oct 2025)
Over the last 18 months, our software eCommerce dataset revealed a story of growth, loyalty, and strong recurring revenue.
This challenge—powered by ONYXDataDNA’s—showed how the right mix of digital products, pricing, and customer behavior can shape business performance at scale.

📘 Story Highlights
Between 22 April 2024 and 21 October 2025, customers purchased a wide range of software tools—from Developer Tools and Cloud Services to AI Productivity apps. What stood out was how consistently these products attracted repeat buyers, forming the backbone of long-term revenue.

Channels like Website and Direct Sales drove the bulk of the $31.8M revenue, while subscription-based products delivered dependable monthly inflows — a sign of strong product-market fit.

Customer loyalty emerged as a major strength. Loyal customers accounted for a large share of revenue, often returning within 45 days, resulting in a 100% repeat purchase rate within the period. This level of stickiness is rare and highly valuable for any SaaS-led business.

On the product side, Microsoft 365 and Azure AI subscriptions led the charts, supported by smart discounting strategies and consistently high selling prices. With 97% of revenue coming from subscription SKUs, the business sits on a predictable and scalable revenue model.
